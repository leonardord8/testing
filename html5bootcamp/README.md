→ [index](#index)

###Duration

Five weeks total.

Three weeks for guided learning and two weeks for app development.

→ [index](#index)

###Technical Assistance

You can contact other bootcamp participants or any available tutor if you need technical assistance. We will create one chat for boot camp members only, and another one for boot camp members and tutors when boot camp starts.

###Performance Measurement

1. Code review after each practice and sprint

2. Checkpoint completion after Learning stage with your assigned tutor

→ [index](#index)


###Handling Advanced Developers

Developers that move faster than average can go ahead and complete as much exercises as wanted.

→ [index](#index)

###Tools

1. At least, three different browsers installed on the developer machine. Example, Chrome, Firefox, and the Android browser using Android's emulator.

2. The IDE to use is [SublimeText](http://www.sublimetext.com/).

3. Skype Account + headset (audio calls)

4. Create your own[ GitHub](https://github.com/) account. Follow this[ guideline](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git) to setup your account.

5. Install your own NodeJS server.
  * Download [NodeJS](http://nodejs.org/)
  * Install `http-server` globally, by running `npm install -g http-server`
  * To start the server, from a command line interface, run `http-server` in the directory where you will clone the startup repo
  * Open your web browser and point to localhost:PORT (the `http-server` should have outputted the number of PORT you should use)

6. Fork this repo [https://github.com/globant-ui/startup](https://github.com/globant-ui/startup) to use as a base to host the project code.

###General Guidelines

The boot camp is organized in the following way:

1. The first three weeks will be used for intensive self learning. Each topic will have reading and practices parts. Tutors will be available to answer technical questions on a given chat room.

2. The next two weeks will be used to develop an application following a life process.

3. The project manager will coordinate learning days encouraging team communication in daily meetings.

4. The project manager will gather information regarding individual progress so we can look for alternative assistance where needed.

5. The project manager will lead the boot camp sprints as if it were a real project using SCRUM agile methodology.

6. Two boot camp chats will be created for feedback and technical assistance:

    1. Bootcamp HTML - ALL
Every person participating in the bootcamp is present here (students, tutors and PMs). Here is the place to ask for technical assistance!

    2. Bootcamp HTML - Assistants
Here you will reach just your boot camp fellows for asking question sharing knowledge.

7. Team play is encouraged but the work will be evaluated per person.

8. Sprint duration will be 1 week.

9. The instructions will be vague as they generally are in real life projects. You must look for support and guidance from your PM, teammates and tutors.

10. All code and documentation must be in English.

11. Code must adhere to Globant’s UI [HTML](https://github.com/globant-ui/html-style-guide), [CSS](https://github.com/globant-ui/css-style-guide) and [JavaScript](https://github.com/globant-ui/JavaScript-style-guide) coding guidelines.

###Proposed Test Applications

The test application will consist in a Last.fm client.

###Learning Days###

Each day you will grab the fundamentals of the key building blocks for the next generation mobile apps; yeah, web apps! Web apps powered by the latest, and coolest toolkits, and techniques.

On each learning day you will have to:

1. ####Read:####
We will provide you with documentation related with current sprint content so you can have a background reference, guide and examples to complete the following practice.

2. ####Practice:####
You will implement the previously gathered knowledge in simple coding activities.
Most important task numbers are listed in the "*Key Points*" section for each day and they should get most of your attention; if you feel you don’t have enough time to complete all tasks, start with these ones when possible.

3. ####Commit:####
You will commit all your code on a daily basis, when you finish your practice.

### Introduction

At high level you could see the keys as:

![technologies logos](assets/html5-css-javascript.png "The platform")

HTML describes the content semantics and structure of a web page. It was designed as a markup language, if you know XML, you could consider HTML as a subset of XML with a predefined semantic.

On the other hand, CSS allows to define the look and feel of the content. It's used to set colors on HTML elements, customize sizes, define the layout of the document content, among others. (e.x. "The following list of elements must be shown as a menu", "The main title of the page should use this particular font").

JavaScript is a programming language that runs in all Web Browsers. Using JavaScript we can create full-fledge web applications.

Now that you know which are the three pilars of a web application's UI, it's time to dive into them.

####[Topic 0: HTML & CSS Basics](https://github.com/globant-ui/css-lab)

####Topic 1: JavaScript Intro and jQuery####

#####Reading:#####

1. Beginners: Eloquent JavaScript [basic tutorial](http://eloquentjavascript.net/) (in case you need it!)

2. Beginners: Have fun with [Codecademy](http://www.codecademy.com/courses/jquery-and-the-dom) (more experienced devs might find it fun!).

3. Recommended: [jQuery Fundamentals](http://jqfundamentals.com/)

4. Explore [jQuery documentation](http://docs.jquery.com/Main_Page)

5. JavaScript Prototypes: [http://www.slideshare.net/Dmitry.Baranovskiy/demystifying-prototypes-6183470](http://www.slideshare.net/Dmitry.Baranovskiy/demystifying-prototypes-6183470)

#####Extra documentation:#####

* Web Platform Documentation Project: [http://www.webplatform.org/](http://www.webplatform.org/)

* MDN JavaScript Reference: [https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference)

* Annotated ECMAScript 5.1: [http://es5.github.com/](http://es5.github.com/)

* JSONP and CORS: [http://json-p.org/](http://json-p.org/) - [http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/cors/](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/cors/)

* Using Chrome console to debug JavaScript [https://developer.chrome.com/devtools/docs/console](https://developer.chrome.com/devtools/docs/console)

#####Practice:#####

1. Open your IDE, create a new file text, save it as index.html. Add the correct doctype, and a few tags with random content. Add jQuery's latest version.

2. Add a stylesheet to the index.html. Use the stylesheet to center the text of all ```section``` elements of the page.

3. Add a hidden ```section``` with the following text inside: "Hello world".

4. Add a button below the ```section``` to your index.html.

5. When the page has finished loading the section must fade in.

6. Add a textbox with the class "alias", and put the cursor inside it right after the ```section``` fades in.

7. Attach an event to the created button which calls a function that gets a response from [http://bootcamp.aws.af.cm/welcome/yourname](http://bootcamp.aws.af.cm/welcome/yourname)

8. Write the response to the ```section``` element.

9. Show ```section``` content in red when a server error occurs.

10. Take some free air and then create a function to highlight your name in the server response content. Call it right after setting the response inside the div.

11. AJAX: get the response from [https://api.spotify.com/v1/search](https://api.spotify.com/v1/search) with parameters data "q = 'Rolling Stones', type = 'album'"
First log the service response in Chrome's console to analyze data (see provided link on Chrome console), then display albums inside another section in the right side of the screen. The ```article``` element must be used to contain the album data.
For each album show: name, type, image, release_date, and a link to spotify for that album.

12. Add an input type="text", and reuse the code for exercise 11, so the user can perform search for any artist albums.

13. Validate your page using W3C validator: [https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/web-developer/](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/web-developer/)

#####Key Points:#####

####Topic 2: Design Patterns and OOP in JavaScript####

#####Reading:#####

1. Understand JavaScript Prototypes: [http://javascriptweblog.wordpress.com/2010/06/07/understanding-javascript-prototypes/](http://javascriptweblog.wordpress.com/2010/06/07/understanding-javascript-prototypes/)

2. Understand JavaScript OO: [http://javascriptissexy.com/oop-in-javascript-what-you-need-to-know/](http://javascriptissexy.com/oop-in-javascript-what-you-need-to-know/)

3. Read [this](http://addyosmani.com/resources/essentialjsdesignpatterns/book/) article about JavaScript design patterns by Addy Osmani

#####Extra documentation:#####

* [JavaScript Patterns Collection](http://shichuan.github.com/javascript-patterns/)

* [A fresh look at JavaScript Mixins](http://javascriptweblog.wordpress.com/2011/05/31/a-fresh-look-at-javascript-mixins/). Pay attention on the section about the ```extend```function. That function is one of the *MOST* used patterns in JavaScript for code reusability.

#####Practice:#####

1. Create a Movie object:

    <table>
        <tr>
            <td>Movie</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>-attributes : hashmap</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>+ play() <br />+ stop()<br />+ set(attr:string, value)<br />+ get(attr:string)</td>
        </tr>
    </table>

2. Instantiate some of your favorite movies and play with them in the console.

3. Add a MovieObserver class that listens for "*playing*" and “*stopped*” events.

4. Publish "*playing*" event on Movie.play(). You should be able to do something like this in the console:

    ```js
    var terminator = new Movie();
    terminator.set('title', 'Terminator');
    // ...
    terminator.play(); // output: Playing Terminator...
    ```

5. Publish "*stopped*" event on Movie.stop().

6. Log to console when each event is fired.

7. Refactor Movie class as a Module keeping your previous code for reference.

8. Create a DownloadableMovie that extends from Movie adding a download method. Here you will have to set the correct ```prototype``` to DownloadableMovie.

9. Create a  mixin object called Social with the methods: share(friendName) and like().

10. Apply the mixin to Movie object and play with the console output. You should be able to do something like this in the console:

    ```js
    var ironman2 = new Movie();
    ironman2.set('title', 'Iron Man 2');
    // ...
    ironman2.share('V. Rivas'); // output: Sharing Iron Man 2 with V. Rivas
    ```

11. Create an Actor class and create some actors from one of your favorite movies.

12. Show how you would add an array of actors to a Movie object.

####Topic 3: NodeJS, NPM, and JavaScript Modules####
There are three ways to write modules in JavaScript: AMD, CommonJS, and ES6 Modules. In this topic, you will learn how to write CommonJS modules. CommonJS is the module format used by NodeJS, and through the use of browserify they can be used in a browser. ES6 modules will be the standard way to write JavaScript in the future, once the major browsers finish to add that feature.

#####Reading:#####

1. For a good introduction to JavaScript Modules [Modules::Eloquent JavaScript](http://eloquentjavascript.net/10_modules.html)

2. Read about AMD, CommonJS, and ES6 Modules [Writing Modular JavaScript](http://addyosmani.com/blog/writing-modular-javascript/)

3. Read on how to use Browserify [Browserify Handbook](https://github.com/substack/browserify-handbook)

#####Practice:#####

1. Create a new directory for this topic, and add a package.json. Tip: use ```npm init```.

2. Install browserify globally in your environment. Tip: ```npm install -g browserify ```.

3. Create the same Movie class as in the previous practice, but inside a CommonJS module. Tip: use ```module.exports```.

4. Create a Director class inside a module and set it as a dependency on the Movie module. Tip: use ```require```.

5. Create a movies.js file using browserify. Add that script to an index.html. Check that it works opening it in the browser.

6. Add name:string, a quotes:array properties, and a speak() method to Director; calling speak() will return director’s quotes.

7. Add a Director to a Movie. Implement the following API:
```
var alien = new Movie();
var ridleyScott = new Director(‘Ridley Scott’);
ridleyScott.set('quotes', ['Cast is everything.', 'Do what ...']);
alien.set('director', ridleyScott);
alien.get('director').speak(); //output: Ridley Scott says: 'Cast is...'
```

8. Add jQuery as a module.

9. Using jQuery show Director quotes.

#####Practice:#####

1. Write one Handlebars template to show the details of a movie (name, year, description or plot, genre, etc). Use [imdb](http://www.imdb.com/) or [Netflix](http://www.netflix.com/) for inspiration.

2. Create a second template to render a list of movies.

3. Using Backbone, create a movie listing with your favorite movies. Data shall be persisted in localhost.

4. Show movie details in a separate details view.

5. Allow to add / edit / remove movies from the list.

6. Add Jasmine tests for the different views and models.

Tips:
* Create a Model that represents a movie.
